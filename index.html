                <hr>
                <p>I'm Shamkhalil Khalilov, a student at the Technical University of Azerbaijan. I've been studying there for 2 years and have a wide variety of interests ranging from competitive programming to graphical engineering and even music. Over the past 6 months, I have competed in a dozen or so competitions on websites like Codeforces and AtCoder. In addition to the aformentioned, I have also participated in the 2023 ICPC semi-finals. Furthermore, I have developed a "brute-force" ray tracing application in C++.</p>
                <p>Regarding my skills, I have gained considerable proficiency in both C++ and Python. Primarily, I use C++ for most of my projects, but when it comes to analyzing raw data or similar tasks, I prefer to use Python due to its simple syntax.</p>
                <p>I'm planning to relocate to the Enschede, Netherlands this August to pursue my academics at Twente University, where I plan to study Computer Science and Mathematical Analysis. My future goal is to use the knowledge I have to specialize in graphical engineering as a profession. </p>

              <p>I've implemented a brute-force ray tracer based on a GitHub repository I found. The code is relatively simple as it doesn't utilize any of the newer features of C++. However, since this project served as a means of learning and understanding the fundamentals of computer ray tracing, much of the code is either challenging or nearly impossible to read. The reason to the aformentioned is that, I deviated from the methodologies outlined in the accompanying book, resulting in missed optimizations and making the code somewhat inefficient.</p>

              <p>I've developed a simple web scraper in Python using the Beautiful Soup library to extract information from a book website (https://books.toscrape.com/), providing me with a significant amount of raw data for analysis. This project was a 'two birds with one stone' type of endeavor, where not only did I gain valuable insights into the Python Matplotlib library, but I also acquired hands-on experience with web scraping algorithms. After acquiring the data, I proceeded to process and visualize it using Matplotlib. The visualization focused on three primary categories: book ratings, prices, and titles, which is reflected in the graph to the right of this text.</p>
